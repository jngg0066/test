        <h1>What is Info Hub?</h1> 
        <p>
            The Info Hub serves as a comprehensive resource for visitors seeking information on 
            overseas migration trends in Australia, with a particular focus on the state of Victoria. 
            It provides a detailed analysis of migration data, showcasing the net overseas migration 
            figures over the past decade and offering insights into the significant increase in migrant 
            arrivals, especially post-COVID-19. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The hub also delves into the demographics of Australia's overseas-born population, 
            highlighting the top 5 developed countries of origin and their respective growth patterns over the years. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, it addresses the challenges faced by migrants, such as language barriers, 
            cultural discrimination, educational differences, and social isolation, X, and X to provide a well-rounded 
            perspective on the migration landscape in Australia.

                <h1>Insights into Australia's Migration Trends (2022-23)</h1>
                <p>Record Net Migration: Australia experienced its highest ever net gain of 518,000 people.</p>
                
                <p>Surge in Arrivals: Migrant arrivals increased by 73% to 737,000, with most being 
                    temporary visa holders (554,000).
                </p>
                
                <p>COVID-19 Impact: Pandemic restrictions caused a decline in migration in 2020-21, but numbers are rebounding.</p>
                
                <p>Key Contributors: International students, working holiday makers, and skilled workers were major 
                    contributors to the rise in arrivals.</p>
                
                <p>Permanent Visa and Citizen Arrivals: Arrivals of permanent visa holders and Australian 
                    citizens remained below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
                
                <p>Decrease in Departures: Migrant departures decreased by 2% to 219,000, 
                    contributing to the high net migration.</p>
                
                <p>Future Trends: Anticipated departures of temporary visa holders, such as 
                    international students, may reduce net migration in the future.</p>

                <h1>Insights into Australia's Migration Trends (2022-23)</h1>
                <h2>Proportion of Overseas-born Population:</h2>
                <li>In 2021, 29.3% of Australia's population was born overseas, with variations across states and territories. At the national level in 2021, the largest groups of overseas-born individuals were from England, India, China, and New Zealand.</li>
                
                <h2>Country of Birth Trends:</h2>
                <li>India - The population born in India has shown substantial growth, increasing from 31.14 thousand in 2001 to 272.25 thousand in 2021.</li>
                <li>China - Similarly, the population born in China has seen steady growth, rising from 38.86 thousand in 2001 to 182.14 thousand in 2021.</li>
                <li>Vietnam - The population born in Vietnam has exhibited a fluctuating trend, starting at 59.49 thousand in 2001, dropping slightly to 76.23 thousand in 2011, and then increasing to 99.35 thousand in 2021.</li>
                <li>Sri Lanka - The population born in Sri Lanka has shown consistent growth, rising from 29.86 thousand in 2001 to 72.1 thousand in 2021.</li>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-container">
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Proficiency in English / Language barrier </button>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p> Children of new Australian migrants often encounter language barriers that affect their social and academic interactions. 
                    Strategies such as utilizing translation apps, watching local media with subtitles, and actively noting new vocabulary 
                    can help them overcome these challenges. Moreover, while initially intimidating, grasping Australian slang becomes more 
                    manageable through exposure and inquiry, ultimately supporting smoother integration into daily life.</p>

                <p>
                    Example: Though India boasts the second-largest English-speaking population, fluency remains low (10%). Educational and 
                    cultural barriers, along with historical baggage, make teaching English a complex task. 
                </p>
            </div>
        
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Culture discrimination / Xenophobia</button>
            <div class="collapsible-content"> 
                <p>Culture shock refers to the emotional response triggered by encountering unfamiliar customs and behaviours in a new country. 
                    Australian culture, characterized by its casual and individualistic nature, may contrast with the collectivistic norms prevalent 
                    in some Asian cultures. Children may need to adapt to less formal greetings, reduced emphasis on hierarchy (e.g., respect for elders, 
                    teachers), and a more direct communication style. Acquiring an understanding of social norms, such as direct communication and humour, 
                    aids in adaptation. Additionally, prioritizing social connections and engaging in activities like sports clubs facilitates integration 
                    into Australian culture.</p>

                <p>
                    Example: A Scanlon Foundation study finds mainland Chinese immigrants in Australia struggle more to integrate than some East Asians. 
                    Language barriers, social isolation, especially for older migrants, and rising discrimination threaten their progress.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Education differences</button>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>For parents with children, it's crucial to grasp the Australian education system to secure their optimal learning journey. Learn about 
                    various school levels, curriculum, and enrolment procedures. Communicate with local schools, discussing your child's requirements to 
                    identify the ideal educational setting for them.</p>

                <p>
                    Example: Migrant boys in Australia, especially from cultures with lower gender equality in education, score lower on standardized tests
                    compared to boys from non-migrant backgrounds. This suggests cultural factors, not just migration itself, influence academic performance.
                </p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Social Isolation </button>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>New migrant children in Australia may find it challenging to make friends. Building relationships requires patience and persistence, with 
                    shared hobbies aiding in socialization. Effective communication and maintaining a positive outlook about the move are essential for 
                    fostering successful friendships.</p>

                <p> 
                    Example: Migrants in Australia who integrate into society ("Australian acculturation") report higher well-being than those who maintain
                    only their heritage culture, according to a study on over 300 migrants. Well-being includes overall life satisfaction and satisfaction in
                     specific areas like health and relationships.
                </p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Mental health</button>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Language barriers, cultural discrimination, and social isolation can have adverse effects on the mental health of migrant children. Findings
                    from Building a New Life in Australia, a longitudinal study of resettled humanitarian migrants and their families in Australia, presented a 
                    mixed picture of children’s mental health. Some age groups had poorer outcomes on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total 
                    scores, but overall ratings were comparable to the mean scores of Australians of the same age (Winnie et al., 2018).</p>
                <p> 
                    Example: Almost four million Australians are being diagnosed with mental illness each year. But, there are still multiple barriers stopping 
                    people from multicultural backgrounds from seeking mental health help.

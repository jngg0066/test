        <h1>What is Info Hub?</h1> 
        <p>
            The Info Hub serves as a comprehensive resource for visitors seeking information on 
            overseas migration trends in Australia, with a particular focus on the state of Victoria. 
            It provides a detailed analysis of migration data, showcasing the net overseas migration 
            figures over the past decade and offering insights into the significant increase in migrant 
            arrivals, especially post-COVID-19. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The hub also delves into the demographics of Australia's overseas-born population, 
            highlighting the top 5 developed countries of origin and their respective growth patterns over the years. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, it addresses the challenges faced by migrants, such as language barriers, 
            cultural discrimination, educational differences, and social isolation, X, and X to provide a well-rounded 
            perspective on the migration landscape in Australia.

                <h1>Insights into Australia's Migration Trends (2022-23)</h1>
                <p>Record Net Migration: Australia experienced its highest ever net gain of 518,000 people.</p>
                
                <p>Surge in Arrivals: Migrant arrivals increased by 73% to 737,000, with most being 
                    temporary visa holders (554,000).
                </p>
                
                <p>COVID-19 Impact: Pandemic restrictions caused a decline in migration in 2020-21, but numbers are rebounding.</p>
                
                <p>Key Contributors: International students, working holiday makers, and skilled workers were major 
                    contributors to the rise in arrivals.</p>
                
                <p>Permanent Visa and Citizen Arrivals: Arrivals of permanent visa holders and Australian 
                    citizens remained below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
                
                <p>Decrease in Departures: Migrant departures decreased by 2% to 219,000, 
                    contributing to the high net migration.</p>
                
                <p>Future Trends: Anticipated departures of temporary visa holders, such as 
                    international students, may reduce net migration in the future.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-container">
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Proficiency in English / Language barrier </button>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Children of new Australian migrants often encounter language barriers that affect their social and academic interactions. 
                    Strategies such as utilizing translation apps, watching local media with subtitles, and actively noting new vocabulary 
                    can help them overcome these challenges. Moreover, while initially intimidating, grasping Australian slang becomes more 
                    manageable through exposure and inquiry, ultimately supporting smoother integration into daily life.</p>

                <p>
                    Example: Though India boasts the second-largest English-speaking population, fluency remains low (10%). Educational and 
                    cultural barriers, along with historical baggage, make teaching English a complex task. 
                </p>
            </div>
        
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Culture discrimination / Xenophobia</button>
            <div class="collapsible-content"> 
                <p>Culture shock refers to the emotional response triggered by encountering unfamiliar customs and behaviours in a new country. 
                    Australian culture, characterized by its casual and individualistic nature, may contrast with the collectivistic norms prevalent 
                    in some Asian cultures. Children may need to adapt to less formal greetings, reduced emphasis on hierarchy (e.g., respect for elders, 
                    teachers), and a more direct communication style. Acquiring an understanding of social norms, such as direct communication and humour, 
                    aids in adaptation. Additionally, prioritizing social connections and engaging in activities like sports clubs facilitates integration 
                    into Australian culture.</p>

                <p>
                    Example: A Scanlon Foundation study finds mainland Chinese immigrants in Australia struggle more to integrate than some East Asians. 
                    Language barriers, social isolation, especially for older migrants, and rising discrimination threaten their progress.
